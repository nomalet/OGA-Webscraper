# OGA-Webscraper
A web scraper for the OGA website (UK Oil &amp; Gas Authority)

The UK OGA (Oil & Gas Authority) changed it website containing production data in 2018. Extracting the data by field and by fluid type has become fairly difficult. Consequently, I built a web scraper to extract the data in an easier fashion.

It should be highlighted that the web scraper is a template for more detailed work. That is to say, it extracts oil production by Field by Month. It could be extended to do so for gas, associated gas, and water. Furthermore, due to the structure of the website, it would require additional complexity to scrape the first 5 years on record. It would be much faster to extract these manually once (copy and paste) and then keep them in a database, where the additional data can be appended to.
